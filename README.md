# ALEVEL-Math-Circular-Motion-Chapter-AI-teaching-bot
AI-powered automation system that reads email attachments, understands math/physics problems from images, and automatically generates Manim animated teaching videos with detailed solution scripts.

AI Teaching Bot – Automated Problem-Solving + Manim Video Generator
This project is an end-to-end automation system that transforms email-based problem submissions into fully animated Manim teaching videos and detailed step-by-step solution scripts.
It uses GPT-5.1 (vision-enabled) to interpret screenshot-based questions, generate reasoning, produce runnable Manim animation code, and render an instructional video — all triggered automatically when a new email with a specific subject arrives.

✨ Key Features
📩 Email Listener: Monitors Gmail via IMAP and detects new “teaching” requests
🖼️ Vision-Based Problem Recognition: Reads math/physics questions from screenshots
🧠 AI Reasoning Engine: Generates rigorous step-by-step explanations
🎬 Manim Video Generator: Produces animated teaching videos automatically
📝 Solution Script Writer: Outputs detailed student-friendly explanation text
🔁 Fully Automated Pipeline: From email → AI → Manim → video output
🎯 Zero Manual Intervention: Runs continuously as an autonomous teaching assistant
This system can be extended into a personal AI tutor, classroom assistant, or a fully automated video-generation workflow for educational content creators.
